		"Prepare their minds ahead of time by adding an estimated survey-completion time. While shorter surveys are likely to have more respondents, don't give a false estimation to bait people to fill your survey.",
		"Data privacy and protection is a huge concern for everyone. Since you plan to collect data from respondents, you need to tell them how you will use this information. You can include a link to your company's privacy policy.",
		"Include instructions on how to fill the survey. Include information about relevant documents for the survey too.",
		"Your survey should be written in simple language your audience understands. It should be friendly, human and show the respondents how much impact they'll make by taking part in the survey. Always include a nice \"thank you\" note in your survey introduction.",
		"A market survey introduction should answer all the questions we looked at when we discussed the features of a survey introduction. After naming your organization, you should also introduce your product or product idea for brand awareness.",
		"At Formplus, we are working to improve online data collection for you. We'd really like to know what you feel about online data gathering tools. Take this 20-minute survey and win a free 1-month Formplus premium subscription. Your data will be collected anonymously and only used for this research. Thank You!",
		"A student survey introduction is the first step in getting the best responses from your students. Encourage students to provide objective feedback and let them know how the information will be used.",
		"In the survey introduction, indicate that all responses will be recorded anonymously. Students need to be sure that they can provide honest feedback in the survey without getting harassed or victimized. ",
		"You need a good research questionnaire introduction during the data-collection phase of your research. People are more likely to fill your questionnaire when they clearly understand what you want to achieve and why your research is important. ",
		"In the research questionnaire introduction, you can include facts, data, or statistics about the research problem. Then, show how the data collected via the questionnaire will contribute to solving the problem. The introduction should also address data privacy, data protection, and participant�s consent. ",
		"Even if you plan to share the questionnaire physically, a good research questionnaire introduction will help collect responses faster and save time. ",
		"Throw in an honorary mention of your brand and then, go through some of the information you�ll need from them in the survey. To increase response rates, you can reward respondents with a gift, discount, or special offer. ",
		"People need to know what they are getting into before filling your survey or questionnaire, and that's exactly why you need a great survey introduction."
